### Nyan Cat Clock Overview

This Fitbit clock features the classic Nyan Cat animation on a simple clockface design.

This clock is design for Fitbit Sense and Versa 3 so other versions are not compatible. 

### Features In Work

-- Dark Mode Setting: option to change animation to a black background for dark mode users
-- Heart Rate, Steps, Calories on main display: toggle to cycle through (or turn off) by tapping on the counter on the main face
-- Always On: Fades into a white outline of Nyan Cat and the stars along with the Time and Date on a black background
